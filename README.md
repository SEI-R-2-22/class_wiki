  <li><details><summary><strong>Week 4</strong></summary><p>

   <p>
     In Week 4, we learn all about <b>React</b> and what an amazing JavaScript library it can be for developers. We learn the concepts of <b>components</b>, <b>props</b>, and about <b>React Hooks</b> and <b>functional components</b>. We learn about <b>useState</b> and how to use it to manage our state within our apps. We also get into how we can use <b>useEffect</b> to make axios calls in our React apps. Finally at the end of the week, we learn <b>React Router</b>, a powerful tool for navigating around our virtual DOM.

  <p>
  In Week 7, we are introduced to <b>React Redux</b> as a new way to manage our state in React! We learn about <b>Reducers</b>, <b>Actions</b>, and <b>Types</b>. We also learn how to map our state and actions to props. We also learn how to use a middleware called <b>thunk</b> in conjunction with Redux. We are introduced to <b>SQL databases</b> and start to learn SQL commands to interact with our database.  We also learn about the concept of <b>SQL Joins</b>. Then, we learn all about <b>Sequelize</b> and how it can interpret for our SQL database and our backend Node servers and we learn how to make <b>queries</b> with it!
